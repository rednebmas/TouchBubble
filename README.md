TouchBubble
===========
This project was inspired by what I'm calling touch bubbles in Google's apps (most notably their Maps app).

To use, copy the UIView+TouchBubble category into your project. To add the touch bubble to a view, call the method `addTouchBubble` on the view. Don't forget to `#import UIView+TouchBubble.h`.
